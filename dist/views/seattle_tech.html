        to Seattle, such as Apple, Airbnb, Indeed and Dropbox. Since 2014, more than 100 out-of-town tech companies have opened their engineering offices in the Seattle metropolitan area.</p>

      <p>Seattle has become second best tech city in the country, behind only San Francisco. Seattle has seen over a 10% increase in tech-job openings since 2016. This increase surpasses any other major tech cities in the country (see the figure above).
